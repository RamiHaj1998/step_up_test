/// Every page you need to navigate to it needs a route class that:
/// - facilitates dealing with route's path params, query params and extra object.
/// - Keeps the router file clean and has no logic. Only route's declarations or general config.
/// - Makes sure that the route's logic of path params, query params and extra object is written once and usable for each navigation operation.
///   *** PLEASE add [queryParamsBuilder], [pathParamsBuilder] and [extraBuilder] static methods as needed. and Don't pass pure maps explicitly in navigation.
/// - Reduces the boilerplate code of creating go routes.
/// - No more maps and static keys outside the route which means more Type-safe navigation.
